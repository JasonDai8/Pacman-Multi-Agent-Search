# Pacman-Multi-Agent-Search
Implementation of a simple version of the popular game Pacman utilizing multi-agent search and expectimax and minimax evaluation functions in Python 

This pdf contains all the implementations of different agent algorithms, consisting of reflex agent algorithm, minimax agent algorithm, alpha-beta pruning algorithm, an expectimax agent algorithm, and finally an evaluation function that analyzes the state rather than a single agent.
